# Navbar Sticky Fix Plan

## Issue
The navbar is not sticking to the top of the page as expected, even though it has the correct CSS properties for sticky positioning.

## Root Cause
The parent container in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` has the class `overflow-hidden` which prevents the navbar from sticking properly.

## Solution
Remove the `overflow-hidden` class from the main container div in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
2. Locate line 21 which contains:
   ```jsx
   <div className=" overflow-hidden">
   ```
3. Remove the `overflow-hidden` class, changing it to:
   ```jsx
   <div>
   ```
   or if other classes are needed:
   ```jsx
   <div className="other-classes">
   ```

## Verification
After making this change, the navbar should properly stick to the top of the page when scrolling down.

## Additional Considerations
- Check if the `overflow-hidden` class was serving any other purpose and address those needs with alternative solutions if necessary
- Test the page on different screen sizes to ensure the sticky behavior works correctly in all scenarios
